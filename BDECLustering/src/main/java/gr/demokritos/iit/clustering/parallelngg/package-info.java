/**
 * This package is a snapshot of the commit f3a87e3ba created on 09/03/2016
 * in https://github.com/gkioumis/ParallelNGG which is a fork of the original
 * https://github.com/ioannis-kon/ParallelNGG (master branch).
 *
 * We could not possibly build an uber jar and reference it as an external dependency,
 * because (a) it contained all spark/hadoop deps (b) was extra large and (c) we could
 * not do any modifications on the fly.
