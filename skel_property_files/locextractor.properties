# extractor config 

# RESTFUL extractor:
##########################
# format:
# -------------
# base-api-url
# article-parameter	// url and text for now
# output-format // e.g. json
# output-specifier // e.g. json id to look for
# <delimiter>	// used below to assign values to fields
# param1<delimiter>value1
# param2<delimiter>value2
# ...
# authentication=uname:pass	// this will be base64 encoded in the http request
# --------------

# username & pass have to follow the above syntax 

# examples:

#poolparty opts:
# https://bde.poolparty.biz/extractor/api/extract
# url
# json
# locations
# =
# language=en
# projectId=dummyentry
# locationExtraction=true
# authentication=username:pass

# climate tagger opts:
# http://api.climatetagger.net/service/extract
# text
# json
# locations
# =
# locale=en
# format=json
# locations=true
# token=get one from the API

# default extractor config
##########################
# the default extractor config provides the ability to manually include additional location names
# and/or substitute matches with other/extra names.
# The articles are checked naively for the inclusion of these names

# Format expected:
# 
# use_extras=yes/no 		// to enable or disable it. Default is no.
# only_use_extras=yes/now   // just check the extra names, do not extract locations as normal
# location1 /// locationOverride *** locationAdditional		// substitution & expansion syntax
#
# Additional location names are added for either a substitution of location1 or a "genuine" ocurrence of locationOverride in the article text.
# For example:
# Exharcheia /// Athens *** Attica
# articles containing "Exarcheia" will be assigned with location Athens INSTEAD of Exharceia. 
# The additional location name "Attica" will also be assigned to that article.
#
# Term omission works as expected, i.e.
# shire *** mordor  will also add mordor to articles containing the shire
# shire /// gondor  will add gondor to articles containing the shire (without adding the shire)
