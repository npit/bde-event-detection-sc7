# Format expected:
# location string name to match /// actual location string name that will be stored *** additional location string name to assign
# For example: 
# Exharcheia /// Athens *** Attica 
# articles containing "Exarcheia" will be assigned with location Athens instead of Exharceia. The additional location name "Attica" will also be assigned.
